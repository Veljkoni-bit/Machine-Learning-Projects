# Machine Learning Projects
Some cool machine learnig projects I did, from which I learned ML.
I covered all segments of ML and every segment had it's own data set I worked with.
For regression and classification I only uploaded code with Random Forest Model because it showed best results at the end, and for dimensionality reduction I only uploaded Kernel PCA and not regular PCA because also showed better results, when it comes to NLP I only did Bag-Of-Words model for now because I'm still in process of learning different models of NLP and entering Seq2Seq part and I hope I will soon upload that part :).
For reinforcment learning I uploaded Thompson Sampling and Upper Case Bound Algorithms and because I didn't do for real ads I used dataset full of 0's and 1's for 10 ads and 10000 cases which and one row represents one case or one human who if it has 1 under one ad (column) that means he clicked on that ad and if there is 0 under one ad that means that person didn't clicked on the specific ad.
