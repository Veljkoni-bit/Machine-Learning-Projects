# Machine Learning Projects
Some cool machine learnig projects I did, from which I learned ML.
Movie Recommendation System is amazing thing to come across and even more amazing to build it alone. It's using Items-Based Collaborative Filtering and not User-Based one because it is much more functional and better then user-based which would couse a lot of problems to us for this type of projects.
Convolutional Neural Networks is something to be really excited to make and build even if it's just makeing him make prediction is it a cat or a dog, but just imagine with not much change to include camera and so on what can we make.
Artificial Neural Networks is just amazing to be able to build a virtual brain with artificial neurons and to teach your machine how to think and how to learn and make predictions on it's on, now matter if it's regression and we are predicting a continous value or classification and we are predicting a category(class).
